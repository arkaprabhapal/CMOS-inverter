- # Transistor Parameter Comparison â€” L vs. 5L

This repository provides a comparative analysis of key electrical parameters for MOS transistors with channel lengths `L` and `5L`. The data highlights performance metrics across different input voltages (Vi), which are useful in analog/mixed-signal circuit design and optimization.

## ðŸ“˜ Parameter Guide

## ðŸ”¬ Applications

This data serves as a reference for:
- Device sizing in analog IC design
- Performance modeling across technology nodes
- Input sensitivity analysis

## 2. Determining the DC current  
- Lower Limit : It is calculated by the slew rate of the OTA and it came to be 50Î¼A.
- Upper Limit : it is calculated from the maximum power consumption of the circuit and it came to be 55.55Î¼A.
- So, I chose the DC current to be **55Î¼A** as it satisfies both criterias.
- 
## 3. Determining the dimensions of MOSFETs
We are considering the **Length(L)** of all mosfets as 1Âµm.
### 3.1 Input pair NMOS 
Its dimensions were calculated from UGF. The calculated value of (W/L) was 6. But by not getting the expected gm from this W/L ratio in the simulation, I changed it to **7**.
### 3.2 Current mirror PMOS 
Its dimensions were calculated from ICMR+ value. The calculated value was (W/L) = **7**.
### 3.3 Current mirror NMOS
Its dimensions were calculated from ICMR- value and the calculated value was (W/L) = **5.87**

## 4. Initial analysis
### At ICMR = 0.8V
- ![Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aa7f112-9508-4afa-8250-f48ceebdc3fe)
- ![Screenshot-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/459ecb4e-d831-4714-9618-14f39dd1a5f8)
- Gain = 38.5dB and UGF = 5.04 MHz
### At ICMR = 1.6V
- ![Screenshot-4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2f19236-3c48-4963-8041-36b2338b3b24)
- ![Screenshot-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6876d200-7ac2-4e22-9dcd-96a14a0d876f)
- Gain = 34.2 dB and UGF = 5.07 MHz
The gain is slightly low at ICMR = 1.6V and the ouput DC voltage level is slightly low than calculated. So the circuit is tuned accordingly.
### Power consumption
- I have observed the changed of Io w.r.t change in ICMR voltage.
- ![Screenshot-12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e422a9d-b032-4374-bcf0-c21548ef38c7)
It has been observed that Io increases linearly w.r.t Input common mode voltage. And at ICMR = 1.6V, Io = 57.42 Î¼A. But the maximum limit is 55.55 Î¼A. So, the value of current in current source of current mirror is tuned accordingly.

## 5. Final Transistor tunings
- **Current mirror PMOS** : (W/L) = **8**
- **Input pair NMOS** : (W/L) = **9**
- **Current mirror NMOS** : (W/L) = **5.87**
- **Value of DC current of the OTA** : Io = 53 Î¼A. This is the value of current at current source of the current sink of the OTA structure.

- Gain = 36.18 dB and UGF = 5.61 MHz
### Power consumption
- The value of Io is measured w.r.t change in Input common mode voltage.
![Screenshot-21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72766050-c5f7-4564-95a5-205155611bea)
- Io increases linearly w.r.t ICM voltage and 52.97 Î¼A â‰¤ Io â‰¤ 55.37 Î¼A.
- So, Power consumption, P ranges between 95.346 Î¼W â‰¤ P â‰¤ 99.66 Î¼W.
